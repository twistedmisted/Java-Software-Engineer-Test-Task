# Project Enhancements

This project has undergone significant improvements to enhance its performance, efficiency, and functionality. Below are the key enhancements made:

## 1. Multi-Tenancy Implementation

### Added Packages and Classes:
- **`config` package:**
    - `ApplicationConfiguration`, `DataSourceBasedMultiTenantConnectionProviderImpl`, `HibernateConfig`, `TenantConnectionProvider`, `TenantContext`, `TenantDataSource`, `TenantSchemaResolver`.
- **`interceptor` package:**
    - `RequestInterceptor`.

### Functionality Overview:
- Introduced a 'database per tenant' mechanism for isolation and efficiency.
- Utilizes MySQL databases for individual tenants and an efficient database (master) for broader application usage.
- Created a dedicated [microservice](https://github.com/twistedmisted/tenant-miroservice) for tenant registration and database access management.
- Integrated Flyway for database schema versioning.

## 2. Request Caching Integration

### Added Features:
- Enabled caching using the `@EnableCaching` annotation.
- Implemented caching mechanisms for the following services: `LessonService`, `StudentService`, `StudioService`, `TeacherService`.
- Included a cron task to clear caches every 10 minutes for improved performance.

## 3. Multithreading Integration

### Observations:
- After careful analysis, no viable opportunities for multithreading were identified.
- Operations within the application were found to be simple and did not necessitate multithreading due to their low complexity and resource requirements.

## Implementation Details

### Tenant Specification and Request Handling:
- The `config` package facilitates the specification of tenants for each request.
- The `interceptor` package, with the `RequestInterceptor`, retrieves the tenant ID from the header and assigns it to the current thread using `TenantContext`.

### Tenant Management Microservice:
- A separate microservice has been created to manage tenants.
- The current application communicates with the tenant service to retrieve database configuration details.

These enhancements significantly improve the application's efficiency, performance, and scalability, ensuring better isolation for tenants, optimized request handling, and streamlined caching mechanisms.
